# :briefcase: In ºN ºOut ‚Äî Time Tracking System

## :globe_with_meridians: Overview  
This repository contains the final project from the **PHP 7 Complete ‚Äì Web Developer Course 2021 + Projects** (Udemy). I applied PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database concepts, and the MVC design pattern to build **In ºN ºOut**, a time tracking system that allows you to:

- Manage employees (create, edit, and delete users)  
- Record time punches (clock-in and clock-out)  
- Generate individual monthly reports for each employee
